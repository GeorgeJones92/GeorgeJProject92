    <h5>INTERACTING WITH THE MAP</h5>
</div>
<div class="w3-theme-l2 w3-container">
    <h3>VIEWING LAYERS</h3>
    <p>The layers menu, which can be opened using the &ensp;<a class="w3-btn" style="font-family:'Montserrat', sans-serif; font-size:0.4em; cursor:default"><i class="fa fa-database" aria-hidden="true"></i>&ensp;LAYERS</a>&ensp; button at the upper right of the page, displays all of the different sets of data that can be laid onto the map. Visible layers are represented with dark buttons, while inactive layers feature light buttons. You can use the search box to assist you in finding a layer of a given name or related to a given subject. Always underneath these layers is the basemap, which can be selected using the &ensp;<a class="w3-btn" style="font-family:'Montserrat', sans-serif; font-size:0.7em; cursor:default">CHANGE BASEMAP</a>&ensp; button within the layers menu.</p>
    <p>Some layers (namely City Council Districts, Community Safety Zones, Drone Areas, Fire Hydrants, and Water Service Book Pages) provide more information when features within them are tapped on. This information appears in the form of a pop-up.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>SEARCHING</h3>
    <p>The search menu, accessed using the &ensp;<a class="w3-btn" style="font-family:'Montserrat', sans-serif; font-size:0.7em; cursor:default"><i class="fa fa-search" aria-hidden="true"></i>&ensp;SEARCH</a>&ensp; button at the upper right of the page, allows you to easily find a location on the map based on its legal address or plat. Upon opening the search menu, starting typing your address or plat of interest into the appropriate search box to begin receiving suggestions (possible matches) for your search. Once a suitable suggestion appears within the list, click on its button to be brought to the location it represents.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>QUERYING</h3>
    <p>You can view information about (query) some of the most frequently-needed data for any location on the map by simply tapping on the location in question. Doing so will cause a marker <img alt="" src="resources/leaflet/images/marker-icon.png" style="height:1.3em"> to appear on the map for the location you've queried and a panel to display on the right side of the page with information about the location.</p>
    <p>This information is presented in the form of tiles. Tapping the title of a tile will show you its corresponding layer from the layer menu (note that doing so will clear all other layers you may have turned on). Additional relevant information can be obtained from links within the tiles, which are underlined. A sample tile is displayed below.</p>
    <!-- Sample tile -->
    <div class="w3-card-4 w3-margin w3-theme-l3" style="max-width:240px; position:relative">
        <i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true" style="position:absolute; right:3px; top:3px; color:white; font-size:0.6em"></i>
        <h6 class="w3-margin-0 w3-theme-d3" style="font-size:80%; text-align:center">TITLE</h6>
        <h3 class="w3-margin-0" style="text-align:center">Primary info</h3>
        <p class="w3-margin-0" style="font-size:80%; text-align:center">Additional info
        <br><u>Link to more info</u></p>
    </div>
    <!-- End sample tile -->
    <br>
    <h6>STREET VIEW</h6>
    <p>Upon querying a location (detailed above), you can get a street-level panoramic view of the location you've queried by clicking the &ensp;<a class="w3-btn" style="font-family:'Montserrat', sans-serif; font-size:0.7em; cursor:default"><i class="fa fa-street-view" aria-hidden="true"></i>&ensp;STREET VIEW</a>&ensp; button at the top of the panel that appears at the right side of the page. While viewing the street-level image, you can tap the directional arrows floating above the street to move the indicated direction along the street. Tapping and dragging the image will cause your view to rotate. You can magnify or minify your view using the&ensp;<i class="fa fa-plus"></i>&ensp;or&ensp;<i class="fa fa-minus"></i>&ensp;buttons, respectively, in the bottom right of the image. A compass is provided immediately above these buttons to provide the heading (compass direction) of your view; the red triangle points north. You can expand your view to occupy the entire screen by clicking the&ensp;<i class="fa fa-arrows-alt"></i>&ensp;button at the top right of the image; clicking the&ensp;<i class="fa fa-times"></i>&ensp;button that appears at the top right of the image will exit this fullscreen mode.</p>
    <p>By default, your initial view faces south. However, if you have clicked on an addressed point before entering street view, your initial view will generally face in the direction of that point. This feature is less reliable at locations near road intersections, so observe your heading carefully using the compass provided near the bottom right of the image.</p>
    <p>Street-level images are not available everywhere in the Aberdeen area, particularly along new roads and rural roads. If this is the case, you will see the error message "No Street View available" on a black background in place of a street-level image. This can also occur if the location you query is a significant distance (half of a typical Aberdeen city block or more) away from the nearest road with street-level images available; in this case, try querying a location closer to the road.</p>

    <h5>TOOLS</h5>
</div>
<div class="w3-theme-l2 w3-container">
    <p>Four tools are provided in the upper left of the page to help you navigate or measure the map:</p>
    <p>+ &emsp; Zoom in. This can also be done by scrolling your mouse wheel forward or spreading two fingers apart on a touchscreen.</p>
    <p>- &emsp; Zoom out. This can also be done by scrolling your mouse wheel backward or pinching two fingers together on a touchscreen.</p>
    <p><i class="fa fa-map-marker"></i> &emsp;Locate yourself: Detect your location and pan the map to it. You may be asked by your web browser for permission to share your location.</p>
    <p><img alt="icon of two rulers intersecting at a ninety-degree angle" src="resources/leaflet-measure/dist/images/rulers_help.png" style="height:1em">&emsp;Measure: Measure distances and areas, and get geographic coordinates for points.</p>
    <p><i class="fa fa-home"></i>&emsp; This icon will take you back to the default extent of the page once you have zoomed in. It essentially acts as a page refresh.</p>
